#### Application Name: Meal Planner
#### Application Description: 
Our app tracks the nutrition intake of users based on calories and nutritional value. It allows them to plan their meals on a day to day basis on a weekly calendar. Bot Meal Planner is similar to other calorie tracker apps.
In addition, there is a social media page on the app that allows users to update friends and followers about their progress by sharing images, their calendars, and exercise activity.

#### Vision Statement: 
For users that want to gain or lose weight, as well as eating healthier, Bot Meal Planner is a nutritional tracker for users to reach their goals. Unlike MyFitnessPal, we have a built- in bot and a social media page to motivate users.
